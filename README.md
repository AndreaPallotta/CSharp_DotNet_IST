## ISTE 340 - Project 3

## Above and Beyond

 What I think I did above and beyond was using Bulma.css to handle the design, like I did in project 2. 
 Alongside with Undergraduate and Graduate, I also implemented a Minor Page.
 Only the basic information is showed on load, while the rest is hidden in modal screens that are opened when the cards are clicked.
 I changed the landing page from faculty to About. 
 Graduate and Undergraduate are now grouped together in the same window.
 I used jquery.dataTables plugin to format the coop and employment tables.
